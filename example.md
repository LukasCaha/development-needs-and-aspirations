# Example Playthrough: The "Spotify" Path (B-2-X)

**Context:** The player chooses **Quality** $\rightarrow$ **Design** $\rightarrow$ **Data**.
**Goal:** Demonstrate how the AI adapts the _tone_ and _descriptions_ of the options based on previous choices.

### **phase_01_start.md**

**System:**

> "Welcome, Founder.
>
> You have 3 empty chairs and a vision. The market is crowded, and only the clearest DNA survives. We are not just hiring employees; we are choosing the _soul_ of your company.
>
> Let's place the first stone in the foundation. Everything else will rest on this."

---

### **phase_02_step_1.md (The Foundation)**

**System:**

> "In the heat of a launch, when everything is breaking, what is the ONE thing you refuse to compromise on?"
>
> - **A. Speed.** (If we are not first, we are dead. Ship it now, fix it later.)
> - **B. Quality.** (If it is not perfect, it does not exist. We do not ship bugs.)
> - **C. Efficiency.** (We must survive. Do not spend a dollar unless it returns two.)

**User:**

> "I choose **B**."

**System:**

> "Understood. You have chosen the hard path. You are not building a toy; you are building a monument. Your team will sleep less, but they will be proud of every pixel.
>
> _Current Team DNA: The Perfectionist._"

### **phase_03_step_2.md (The Driver)**

_Note: The AI adapts the options. It does not offer "The Hacker" (Speed) or "The Scrapper" (Efficiency). It offers "Quality" flavored roles._

**System:**

> "You value perfection above all. To achieve this excellence, who sits in the captain's chair? Who has the final veto on the product roadmap?"
>
> - **1. The High-Stakes Architect (Engineering-Led).**
>   - _The Vibe:_ "The code must be bulletproof."
>   - _The Focus:_ Uptime, security, and zero latency.
> - **2. The Empathetic Artisan (Design-Led).**
>   - _The Vibe:_ "The experience must be seamless."
>   - _The Focus:_ Intuition, flow, and user delight.
> - **3. The White-Glove Operator (Ops-Led).**
>   - _The Vibe:_ "The service must be legendary."
>   - _The Focus:_ Customer support and premium handling.

**User:**

> "I choose **2**."

**System:**

> "A fascinating choice. You demand high stability, but you are leading with emotion and design. You are building a 'Walled Garden'—beautiful, safe, and controlled.
>
> _Current Team DNA: The Perfectionist + The Artisan._"

### **phase_04_step_3.md (The Differentiator)**

_Note: The AI sees a "Quality + Design" team. It asks how this beautiful product scales._

**System:**

> "You have a beautiful, stable product. But beauty alone does not scale. What is the hidden engine that makes this product addictive?"
>
> - **X. The Predictive Brain (Data & Logic).**
>   - _The Pitch:_ "We know what the user wants before they do."
>   - _The Mechanism:_ Algorithms that learn from the user's taste to serve perfect content.
> - **Y. The Circle of Trust (Community).**
>   - _The Pitch:_ "We verify everyone."
>   - _The Mechanism:_ Exclusive access and peer-to-peer reputation.
> - **Z. The Status Symbol (Brand).**
>   - _The Pitch:_ "We are the cool kids' table."
>   - _The Mechanism:_ High prices, exclusivity, and aesthetics.

**User:**

> "I choose **X**."

### **phase_05_result.md (The Archetype)**

**System:**

> "Analyzing your DNA path: **Quality** $\rightarrow$ **Design** $\rightarrow$ **Data**.
> You built a system that feels human but thinks like a supercomputer."

> ### **You Built: The Insight Engine**
>
> _(Archetype B-2-X)_
>
> **Real World Parallel:** **Spotify** (or Netflix)
>
> - **Your Concept:** A beautiful, bug-free interface that uses hard data to personalize the experience. It feels simple, but the backend is incredibly complex.
> - **Your Motto:** _"It just works, like magic."_
>
> **The Team Roster:**
>
> 1.  **The Guardian (Stability):** Ensures the music never buffers and the app never crashes.
> 2.  **The Designer (Experience):** Ensures the 'Play' button is exactly where your thumb expects it to be.
> 3.  **The Data Scientist (Logic):** Built the 'Discover Weekly' algorithm that keeps users subscribed forever.
>
> **Your Superpower:** **Retention.** Users feel deeply understood by your product.
>
> **Your Fatal Flaw:** **The 'Clean Room' Problem.** You might be so obsessed with data and polish that you miss messy, viral social trends (like TikTok).
